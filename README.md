# GUIBillingSystem
Here, I had built a Billing System which has a GUI. The records are saved in a CSV file.


There are 3 files with the project.
1) The Main Program File names as MyBillingSystem.py which imports the other 2.
2) The bills.py which contains functions to deal with the CSV file.
3) Bills.csv which stores the Information.

I had Used Tkinter Module for GUI and csv module for managing CSV file
